          <p className="hero__description">
            It's inevitable that at some point in your life you or a loved one will have to undergo some type of surgery - either as an inpatient or an outpatient. In this event you or a companion, depending on who's having the surgery, will be in a hospital waiting room while the surgery is being performed.
          </p>
          <p className="hero__description">
            It can be quite stressful on the person in the waiting room. But, this can be lessened by knowing how the surgery is progressing. Like many other activities there is a workflow associated with any medical procedure and knowing what state or phase the surgery is in will help whoever is waiting to know what's going on.
